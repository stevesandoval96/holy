    ["Wives, be subordinate to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is head of his wife just as Christ is head of the church, he himself the savior of the body. As the church is subordinate to Christ, so wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything.", 'Ephesians 5:22-24'],

    ['For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands', '1 Peter 3:5'],
    ['Who can find a good wife? She is far more precious than jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.', 'Proverbs 31:10-12'],

    ['but because of cases of immorality every man should have his own wife, and every woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his duty toward his wife, and likewise the wife toward her husband. A wife does not have authority over her own body, but rather her husband, and similarly a husband does not have authority over his own body, but rather his wife. Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, to be free for prayer, but then return to one another, so that Satan may not tempt you through your lack of self-control.', '1 Corinthians 7:2-5'],
    ['But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.', '1 Corinthians 11:3'],
